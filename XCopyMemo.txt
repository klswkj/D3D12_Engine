/K - Use this option when copying read-only files to retain that file attribute in destination.
/D - Use the xcopy command with /d option and a specific date, in MM-DD-YYYY format, to copy files changed on or after that date. 
      You can also use this option without specifying a specific date to copy only those files in source that are newer than the same files that already exist in destination. 
      This is helpful when using the xcopy command to perform regular file backups.
/H - The xcopy command does not copy hidden files or system files by default but will when using this option.
/Y - Use this option to force the xcopy command to prompt you about overwriting files. 
      This might seem like a strange option to exist since this is the default behavior of xcopy but the /y option may be preset in the COPYCMD environment variable on some computers, 
      making this option necessary.
/S - Use this option to copy directories, subdirectories, and the files contained within them, in addition to the files in the root of source. Empty folders will not be recreated.
/I -  Use the /i option to force xcopy to assume that destination is a directory.
      If you don't use this option, and you're copying from source that is a directory or group of files and copying to destination that doesn't exist, 
      the xcopy command will prompt you enter whether destination is a file or directory.
